My CAPL practice programs
CAPL is an acronym for communication access programming language.
Some key characteristics of a CAPL script are:

C-like syntax for easy readability and familiarity to C programmers.

Event-driven: Functions in CAPL react to events such as received messages, expired timers, or changes in signals and system variables, allowing evaluation, signal updates, and message transmission.

Development and compilation: CAPL programs can be created as .can or .cin files and compiled into .cbf files using the CAPL Browser IDE provided by Vector tools.

Direct access to network elements: CAPL scripts can directly access messages, signals, system variables, and diagnostic parameters through database files like DBC, CDD, or ODX-d, thanks to the integration of CAPL Browser with CANoe and CANalyzer.

Extensibility: CAPL can interface with external DLLs, enabling advanced operations such as diagnostic procedures, encryption, and security key/seed calculations.
